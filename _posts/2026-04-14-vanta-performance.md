Interactive backgrounds define the **Elite 2026** experience, but they come at a computational cost. Orchestrating Three.js and Vanta.js requires more than just importing a script; it requires a performance-first mindset.

## Optimization Strategies
*   **Lazy Initialization**: We only boot the Vanta engine when the `theme_config` explicitly calls for it.
*   **Selective Rendering**: By limiting the animation to the hero region and utilizing `IntersectionObserver`, we ensure GPU resources are freed once the user scrolls into the project grid.
*   **Mobile Throttling**: On lower-powered devices, we automatically reduce particle density or transition to high-fidelity static gradients to preserve the user experience.

### Technical Implementation
The TheProFile loader logic wraps the initialization in a conditional logic flow that respects user preferences and system capabilities:

```javascript
if (config.vanta_effect && window.innerWidth > 768) {
  // Boot immersive engine
  initVanta(config.vanta_effect);
}
```

By engineering motion as a progressive enhancement, we ensure that the portfolio remains accessible and lightning-fast across the entire device spectrum.
